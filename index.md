# Statistical Methods for Research Workers: Bayes for Psychologists and Neuroscientists

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Preface

> "[...] we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us statistically significant results"

Ronald J. Fisher (17 February 1890 - 29 July 1962). __The design of experiments__ (1951). p. 14

> "All models are wrong but some models are useful."

George E. P. Box (18 October 1919 – 28 March 2013). __Robustness in the Strategy of Scientific Model Building__ (1979). p. 2.

> "The big problem in science is not cheaters or opportunists, but sincere researchers who have unfortunately been trained to think that every statistically “significant” result is notable."

AndrewGelman (11 February 1965 – ). Essay: The Experiments Are Fascinating. But Nobody Can Repeat Them. The New York Times (19/10/2018). https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/science/science-research-fraud-reproducibility.html

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
