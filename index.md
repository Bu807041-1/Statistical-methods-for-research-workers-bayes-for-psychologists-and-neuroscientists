# Statistical Methods for Research Workers: Bayes for Psychologists and Neuroscientists

[Statistical Methods for Research Workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers), written by [Ronald A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) in 1925, is a landmark publication that ended up not only defining how psychologists and neuroscientists analyse their data, but also influencing how they actually perceive the world.
Almost a hundred years ago, the field of statistics, i.e. mathematics applied to data, was not at all structured in the way it is today, and "research workers" had to refine, and often invent the methods that would best suit their needs.
In this seminal book, Fisher codified what it meant to analyse data for the purpose of creating knowledge about the world, paving the way for what came to be statistics as we now know it. Later, the advent of computers transformed the tools available to analyse data, widening the use of statistics to researchers who did not necessarily need or want to deepen their mathematical understanding of the methods.

It is important to note that we, "research workers", do not have the same experience of statistics. Most psychologists and neuroscientists, for instance, would barely have heard of the debate between Frequentist and Bayesian methods, which can be rocking other scientific fields.
Indeed, in psychology and neuroscience, the teaching of statistics typically follows almost to the letter the table of content from Fisher's book, and it is not unusual for students to only "know" statistics through the menus of a Graphic User Interface on a proprietary piece of software, instead of having acquired enough intuition to understand how distributions of data are manipulated and evaluated.

On this page, we are proposing an opinionated exploration of how Bayesian methods can be applied to the fields of psychology and neuroscience, using [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), with the explicit intent of providing research workers with an opportunity to see and understand what they are doing to their data.
Our motivation stems from our experience of the so-called [Reproducibility Crisis](https://osf.io/qky8t), which has hit both fields.
The Bayesian approach requires commitment to all parts of a given model, and relies on explicit assumptions formulated by the researcher.
Doing good research is thus about justifying one's choices, and not about finding a model that will yield the required number of stars in a table.

Importantly, we do not seek to engage in the debate opposing Frequentists and Bayesians.
Although our preference might show at time, we favour the more oecumenical view that frequentist shortcuts can be justified in precise contexts; a point, we posit even Fisher would concede.
We will do our best to only expect entry-level [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) coding skills and statistics, and to favour explaining over writing optimised code, showing over assuming.

_"The big problem in science is not cheaters or opportunists, but sincere researchers who have unfortunately been trained to think that every statistically 'significant' result is notable."_

### Prerequisites

The ultimate prerequisite for any psychologist or neuroscientist to follow these pages is the willingness to question one's knowledge, and to deepen one's understanding of the methods.

Although you might learn a thing or two, these pages are not about learning [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
The code is documented extensively, and should be readable by anyone who has passing command of English.
Fear not if you do not read [Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) at all, we hope you will still be able to understand what is going on. If you did want to brush up a little, we recommend you start [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/), and hopefully we will even meet you [there](https://aspp.school/).

Perhaps the most difficult prerequisite, however, for a psychologist or a neuroscientist, may be the ability to see the world differently, to ask questions beyond evaluating differences between groups.
The Bayesian method affords more questions to be asked than does the Frequentist method.
In these pages, we apply the Bayesian framework to the subset of questions that would feature in your typical frequentist textbook, which followed suite from Fisher's seminal work, like  [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Discovering-Statistics-Using-Andy-Field/dp/1446200469).
In so doing, we also point out a range of other questions that someone may be interested in.
